**Eldoria** is an immersive strategy game set in a richly detailed world of diverse islands and continents called Eldoria. Players take on the roles of leaders in a dynamic world, where strategic decision-making in resource management, territorial expansion, and diplomatic relations shapes the destiny of their empires. The game blends elements of real-time and turn-based strategy with role-playing, allowing players to choose government systems, form alliances, engage in combat, and contribute to the game's evolution through an innovative player-driven development mechanism. This MVP aims to lay the foundational gameplay elements that will be expanded upon to create a living, breathing game world that evolves with player input and creativity.
